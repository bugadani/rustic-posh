Rustic Paradox
=======================

This repository takes the awesome Paradox theme from [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) and
adds a new prompt section that displays the currently active Rust compiler version if the current folder
contains a `.rs` or `Cargo.toml` file.
